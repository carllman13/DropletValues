- QE more
	- BOE creates money from thin air to buy bonds from Natwest, so BOE earns gilt yield, and pays reserve rate(bank rate)
	- this difference is their profit and is returned to Treasury
	- so in effect Treasury borrowed at bank rate
- DMO vs HM Treasury
	- HM Treasury
		- whole fiscal: spending, tax, etc
		- headed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer
	- DMO
		- executive agency of HM Treasury
		- Agent for HM Treasury, executing debt management strategies that HM Treasury has approved. In this way, the DMO's activities are an extension of HM Treasury's fiscal policies
- Auctions
	- Non-comp allotment
		- for those ppl who don't want to participate int he bidding process but still want the bonds
- Funding
	- Timeline
		- Financial year: Apr 1 to Mar 31
		- Autumn (Nov/Dec) & Spring Budget(Mar)

	- PSNB (accrual)
		- spending - receipts over a period, when they occur
		- includes debt interest
		- is Income
	- **CGNCR**  Consolidated General Net Cash Requirement
		- is Cashflow
		- includes interest on existing gilts
		- focuses solely on cash
		- lower inflation, PSNB pays more real on interest, making it harder to be translated into CGNCR
	- Gross Funding Requirement
		- = CGNCR + Gilt Redemptions
	- PAOF Post Auction Option Facility
		- Allows investors who participate in a bond auction to purchase additional bonds at the same price as the auction for a limited amt of time.
		- Hence imagine i plan to issue 100 this yr. now in first month i issue 50, and remaining issuance got done in another 50 through PAOF. so i'm done for the year and happy. i.e. front loading
